# simple-apollo-server

- A minimal GraphQL layer built on top of [postman-demo API](https://github.com/h0plyn/postman-demo)

## Getting Started

1. `git clone` && `cd simple-apollo-server`
2. `npm i`
3. Follow this [README](https://github.com/h0plyn/postman-demo#postman-demo) to setup the Data Source.
4. `npm start`
5. Your Apollo server is now running on localhost:4000 ðŸš€
6. Run queries in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/) or implement [Apollo Client](https://odyssey.apollographql.com/lift-off-part1/apollo-client-setup) in your front-end app.

Feel free to clone both repos and implement the `users` and `products` GraphQL layer on your own.
